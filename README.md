# PSO Hybridization with GA

## Introduction ##

We are hoping to find a faster method of searching through a solution space by using a hybridization of Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithms. In viewing the difference between both the strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms we have hypothesized that combining the two may overcome the other's faults. This application using both algorithms together, could potentially find better solutions faster, and more efficiently then just using Genetic Algorithms, or Particle Swarm Optimization alone.
